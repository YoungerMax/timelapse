# Timelapse

Record your coding session and rewatch it as a timelapse!

## Selling points

- **Really simple**: One click to record, one click to stop, one click to save
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only `ffmpeg` is required, which many people already have installed
- **Works out of the box**: After `ffmpeg` is installed, you do not need to change any settings around
- **Open source**: You can (and always will be able to) view the source code for yourself and change it however you want (as long as you comply with the license)

## Dependencies

- [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
